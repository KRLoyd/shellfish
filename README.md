# Project Shellfish
## Author: Bobby Yang (Batch 2)

## Synopsis
Project Shellfish is an automated task checker for Holberton School's 0x15. C - Simple Shell project.

## File Breakdown

## Configuration

Open the file `config` and update the variable `SHELL` with your shell.

## Run

Usage `./check_simple_shell.bash`

## Using
1) Install Shellfish
```bash
$ chmod u+x install.sh
$ sudo ./install.sh
```

We are using sudo, so be sure you know what you are doing first! Don't trust us, look in the code!

## Updating
To update the tests, we've built-in an update command that will pull the repo again, and run install again, and removes itself.

```bash
$ shellfish update
```

### Please look into the code before you use it!
